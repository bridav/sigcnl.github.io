My Career
In 2006, I founded the Business Rules Platform Nederland (Dutch Business Rules Platform) union in the Netherlands. I have organized numerous conferences, including the annual EBRC: European Business Rules Conference for the past five years, and the successful 3 Amigos event in the Netherlands. Furthermore, I have also translated the RuleSpeak and business rules manifesto guidelines into Dutch.

Another highlight in my career is that, in 2002, I was invited by the Object Management Group to make a contribution to standardization in the field. The result is the SBVR standard, which was officially accepted in 2005. Standardization is, in my opinion, essential when it comes to bringing a field to a higher level of maturity, and it shows that we take the issue very seriously.

More information about my projects can be found in the projects overview.

My Education
Upon leaving the Montessori Lyceum in Amsterdam, I went on to study Cognitive Artificial Intelligence in Utrecht. In 1996, I completed my Masters with a thesis on genetic algorithms and decision-trees supporting the selection of an automated breeding process. The challenge was to instill confidence in a statistical model of the breeding selection process, and to give an insight regarding the (generated) knowledge. This challenge is, to this day, a common thread running through my career.
